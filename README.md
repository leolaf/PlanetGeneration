## How the sphere is done

  Each planet is a sphere, we use 6 planes (corresponding to every face of a cube).
  We then normalize the position of each triangle to get a sphere shape.
  - Pros : each triangles are roughly the same size and the resolution of the plane can be changed easily
  - Cons : the surface normals aren't conistent around the edges, which will lead to visible seams when lit

### General tweaks  
![Alt text](Images/image-1.png)  
The resolution corresponds to how many squares each planes contains, minus one. So a resolution set to 60 correponds to a plane containing 59x59 squares.  
Face render mask can be used to tell which of the faces of the sphere you want to display (for performance).

**Strength :** the strength of the noise. Higher value means a greater difference between the highest and the lowest point.   
**Number of layers :** layers added together to make more interesting terrain. Start at a relatively low roughness (`Base roughness`) but high amplitude (`Strength`) to create the basic shape of the mesh, then we increment the roughness (by the `Roughness` value) and decrement the amplitude (`Strength` multiplied by the `Persistence` value) to get more details.

**Base roughness :** base frequency of the noise. High value means more abrupt and frequent changes in the noise.    
**Roughness :** for each layers, we will increment the roughness by this value, to get progressively more details.  
**Persistence :** the value with which the strength will be multiply by for each of the noise layers. If <1, the amplitude will decrease.  
**Center :** allows to move the center of the noise.  
**Min value :** the minimum elevation value for the noise to be used. It allows to have an ocean level.
